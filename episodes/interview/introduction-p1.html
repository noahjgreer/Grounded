        <img src="/assets/images/icons/people/noah.png" alt="Noah" class="speaker"><p>Hello everyone, and welcome to Grounded with Matt Round. Today we are starting the introduction with an interview. We're going to get to know Pastor Matt and we're going to dive into some questions about his life. Let's go ahead and get started. Hello Pastor Matt.</p>
        <img src="/assets/images/icons/people/pmatt.png" alt="Pastor Matt" class="speaker"><p>Hello Noah.</p>
        <img src="/assets/images/icons/people/noah.png" alt="Noah" class="speaker"><p>Please introduce yourself for the audience. </p>
        <img src="/assets/images/icons/people/pmatt.png" alt="Pastor Matt" class="speaker"><p>Like you said, my name is Pastor Matt Round. I'm the pastor of Chapel City Church in Camarillo, CA, and I have been for about the last four years or so. Before that, my family and I were up in Canada, where I pastored for five years, and that's kind of our journey in pastoral ministry so far. </p>
        <img src="/assets/images/icons/people/noah.png" alt="Noah" class="speaker"><p>Pastor Matt, when did you become a Christian? </p>
        <img src="/assets/images/icons/people/pmatt.png" alt="Pastor Matt" class="speaker"><p>God was really gracious and put me in a Christian home. Growing up I had strong Christian influences from my parents and my grandparents on my dad's side who were close not only physically but spiritually. So those were really strong influences. I was at church all the time. Growing up was one of those families where if the doors were open, we were there and I was in all the kids choirs and the VBS programs. And so I gave my life to Christ at an early age, probably 7 or so, and I was baptized when I was eight years old. It's not a unique story or a particularly exciting story, but kind of, as is typical, I did my own thing. I never largely walked away from the faith was never really outrageously rebellious, but certainly life was centered around me all the way up through high school, even though I was still involved in Awana and whatever choir programs were going on and youth group and leading that Bible study at my high school. </p>
        <p>If I were to look at who I was then, again, life was really pretty largely about me. And then in college when I was away from home for the first time, when I was away from my church family that I had grown up with and the church that I had grown up in, that was really kind of that crisis moment where your faith becomes your own. And that was the case for me. </p>
        <p>So where was I? When was I saved? Young. But when did God really get a hold of me, and where my faith kind of became my own and I started walking toward maturity intentionally was probably when I was 19 or so and in college. </p>
        <img src="/assets/images/icons/people/noah.png" alt="Noah" class="speaker"><p>That's very interesting, Pastor Matt. Can you tell us about your family that you have today? </p>
        <img src="/assets/images/icons/people/pmatt.png" alt="Pastor Matt" class="speaker"><p>Sure, I'm married to Brandi and that we just celebrated our 20th anniversary and we have 4 kids, 2 girls and 2 boys. Three out of the four of them are teenagers, so we are entering into a whole new life phase of busyness and schedules and personalities and all those things that come along with a family that grows up together. </p>
        <p>We still live fairly close to the majority of both of our families. We're semi-close to our parents physically. Brandi's dad passed away about 10 years ago, but her mom lives in Santa Clarita. My parents live about an hour north of Santa Clarita. We have siblings that are in Santa Clarita and Lancaster and Ventura, so we're pretty well localized here in Camarillo and the general area. </p>
        <img src="/assets/images/icons/people/noah.png" alt="Noah" class="speaker"><p>That's good to hear. Pastor Matt, how did you and your wife meet and how long did you date until you got married?</p>
        <img src="/assets/images/icons/people/pmatt.png" alt="Pastor Matt" class="speaker"><p>So, Brandi and I met a long time ago, especially because we're getting older and older. We actually met the summer before our 7th grade year, so we met after we had both just turned 12 years old. Our moms were involved in a prayer group called Moms in Touch, and that was a group of moms that got together to pray for their kids, to pray for their school, for their teachers, for the administrators, and they decided have a kind of a get together before the school year started. </p>
        <p>So a couple weeks before 7th grade kicked off, we met at the association pool for where my wife lived. And you know the first time I saw her, she was a tiny little blonde thing, and I was pretty well attached right away. I knew that I was deeply in like with her. She took a little bit more convincing. </p>
        <p>As we went through junior high, we were friends. We became very good friends. We did projects together. We had a ton of classes together and moving into high school I continued to pursue her, although it wasn't very overt, I guess. I just did everything I could to be around her. So she ran cross country and I am not physically built for cross country, but I ran cross country just to be involved with that. She was in choir. I didn't really have any desire to be in choir, but I ended up joining choir, again, just 'cause she was a part of that. </p>
        <p>She was actually interested in almost all of my friends at one point. Not at the same time, but kind of one after the other. So it was really more of a war of attrition, and in the end I was just the last guy left standing, I like to say. And we, like I said, we were good friends and best friends, and then we started officially dating I guess our senior year and really that only happened because when we figured out we were planning events with a bunch of people just so we could hang out together, and it was getting more and more obvious to everyone that we were doing it, just to hang out together. </p>
        <p>So we started dating a couple of months before the end of my senior year in high school. And as far as how long we dated, that's kind of interesting because in June, right after I graduated, I left for the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs. We dated for officially maybe three or four months or so. I think our first official date probably would have been winter formal of our senior year and then dated for a few months and then I left. And so we really had very little time to develop kind of a normal dating relationship before I was gone, and it was the first time that I was out of the house and away from my parents and developing any kind of real independence on my own. </p>
        <p>And, you know, I wish that I could say that I handled that really well, fact was that I didn't. And going from home and high school and church life into the military environment was very good and very challenging. You know, there were a lot of things that I really liked a lot of things that were really difficult and we dated long distance for two years. I would write letters or really kind of, more accurately, she would write a lot of letters and I would write <i>some</i> letters back. </p>
        <p>We had very long phone calls that were a lot of silence or we just kind of sat, and this was back in the day when there were calling cards and collect calling, so my parents would get these phone bills for several $100 and you know, 20 minutes would be phone calls to them, and the rest of it would be calls to Brandi. That led to some interesting conversations. </p>
        <p>All in all, it became very clear over that time that neither of us were really ready to pursue a serious relationship, and certainly more of that was falling on me as I was developing again this independent idea of what my faith was and what that looked like and how I was going to follow Christ and as I was wrestling with that and not doing a great job of it, our relationship was suffering and that's that's only natural. You can only really draw close to someone after you're drawing close to God, and as that suffered, our relationship suffered, and I ended up breaking up with her, the day before her birthday, over the phone while I was at the Academy. Which for those of you looking for it, is not spectacular relationship advice. </p>
        <p> So that happened after my first year at the Academy; we dated for less than a year and a half and then we broke up and we were broken up for a year; after two years, I came home and started pursuing her again and we started dating again after sometime after that relationship got built back up and dated for seven months or so after that and then was engaged for a year and we've been married for 20 years since, so it's an interesting thing to ask how long we've been dating, because we dated and then we weren't, and then we came back and so that's kind of how that process looked.</p>
