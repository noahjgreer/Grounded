        In David's Psalm 51 lament, he pleads that God would not remove His Holy Spirit from within him. Many Christians are then drawn to question the permanence of their salvation. Today, we turn to the truths and covenants in God's Word to bring closure. >>> Description (e.g. Welcome to the grounded podcast today we will be interviewing pastor matt for the first time.)
